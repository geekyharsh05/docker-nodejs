In order to run this project, you need to have docker installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Once you have docker installed, you can build the docker image by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker build -t my-node-app .
```

This command will build the docker image and tag it as `my-node-app`. You can replace `my-node-app` with any name you want to give to your docker image.

After the image is built, you can run it by running the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
```

This command will run the docker image and map port `3000` on the host machine to port `3000` in the container. You can replace `3000` with any port number you want to use.

Once the container is running, you can access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see a "Hello, World!" message displayed on the page.

You can also run the application in a detached mode by adding the `-d` flag to the `docker run` command. This will run the container in the background and leave it running even after you close the terminal.

To stop the container, you can use the `docker stop` command followed by the container ID. For example, if the container ID is `1234567890`, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker stop 1234567890
```

This will stop the container with the specified ID.

To remove the container, you can use the `docker rm` command followed by the container ID.  For example, if the container ID is `1234567890`, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker rm 1234567890
```

This will remove the container with the specified ID.
